Port of the [XXH3 hashing algorithm](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/) in
Dart.

```dart
import 'dart:convert' show utf8;
import 'dart:typed_data';

import 'package:xxh3/xxh3.dart';

void main() {
  // Get the string as UTF-8 bytes.
  final helloWorldBytes = utf8.encode("Hello, world!");
  
  // Use XXH3 to hash the byte array (returns an int).
  // XXH3 is a 64-bit hash, so the value is returned in the
  // form of an unsigned 64-bit integer.
  final int digest = xxh3(helloWorldBytes);
  print(digest); // -881777603154417559
  
  // Alternatively, in version 1.1.0+, you can use the
  // xxh3String convenience method to get a hexadecimal
  // string representation of the hash.
  final String hexDigest = xxh3String(helloWorldBytes);
  print(hexDigest); // f3c34bf11915e869
  
  // See the examples and documentation for more...
}
```

## Performance

As it stands, this is a port written entirely in Dart. At the time of writing
it has a throughput of ~0.29 ns/byte (3.16 GB/s) on an Apple M-series processor
in JIT mode or ~0.28 ns/byte (3.23 GB/s) in AOT mode.

You can run the benchmarks yourself on your machine with the following commands:

```bash
# For JIT mode
dart run tool/benchmark.dart
```

```bash
# For AOT mode
dart compile exe tool/benchmark.dart -o benchmark
./benchmark
```

If better performance is needed, `dart:ffi` can be used to call the original
C implementation. This is not currently implemented in this package, but feel
free to open a ticket on GitHub if you would like this.

This assumes that the `int` type is a 64-bit integer, so this will likely not
provide correct results for Dart web (JavaScript), where after 2^53, integers
become floating point numbers. If there is demand for this, that could probably
be addressed by using a custom integer type or a JavaScript `Uint8Array`.

WebAssembly could also be a potential workaround, but I have not investigated
this yet.
