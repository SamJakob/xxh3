## Credits

Inspiration was drawn from the Java implementation here:
- https://github.com/OpenHFT/Zero-Allocation-Hashing/blob/ea/src/main/java/net/openhft/hashing/XXH3.java
Particularly, with respect to implementing the avalanche and mixing functions.

Additionally, chys87's `constexpr-xxh3` implementation was helpful
as a particularly readable example for understanding the algorithm:

...and of course Cyan4973's original XXH3 implementation:
